# What is pyplyn?

## A data pipeline to curate, prioritize, process and store enriched tweets and mentioned articles for analysis, research and reporting.
## A Jamstack site built using the RedwoodJS framework to orchestrate the jobs, services, and visualize that data.

## Proof of concept to take to a client in the wine industry

Twitter is "full" (ok, sometimes) of insightful news and trends. By analyzing curated content you can gain business intelligence:

- üç∑ Identify trends in varietals and brands across the industry which lead to increases in revenue.
- üìà Answer, why and who is partnering with entertainment industry (e.g. Snoop Dog and Australian wine brand, Klingon Star Trek wine)
- üîç Current focus on getting data and rudimentary "analysis"

# Can you? Should you? Is it possible?

* ü•≥ Have built before (Heroku, Redis, Sidekiq, Clock/Scheduler)
* üòí Experimented with AWS Serverless and FaunaDB
* üò∏ There are many ways to do this, established patterns, especially using AWS.
* ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So, what's the answer?

# Yes?

# What does it do?

## Basic Data Pipeline

* ‚õè Curation
* ‚è≤ Ingestion (Scheduled Jobs)
* üß© Enrichment (Fan out)
* üéõ Parsing & Transformation (Fan out)
* üíæ Storage
* üßÆ  Analysis for Visualizations & Reporting

### "Fan-out"

# Demo Part 1

* Dashboard (Rankings, Stats, Mentions, Comparisons)
* Key Scheduled Jobs (Active and All)
* Tweets and Articles
* Trigger Reprocessing locally to show logs
* While we wait for jobs to run ...

# Demo Part 2

* Show notifications
* Look at reprocessed Tweet and Article
* Show Priority and Calendar Charts
* Show completed jobs
* Purge jobs

---

# What works and is important?

* Repeater with functions, libs, and RedwoodJS services
* pMap and Retry and Delay for async fan-out
* Signing function with payload and header JWT
* AWS Serverless -> Netlify Background Jobs (some > 60s)
* Logflare & Pino provide critical visibility (Redaction)
* Charts using Prisma rawSQL and SDL (Bump, Calendar, etc)
* Prisma upserts (prevent/reduce data collisions, loss)

---

# What can be better?

* 202 Async with Netlify less than optimal
* Visibility (logs, errors, retries)
* RedwoodJS log client support (working on it!)
* Pattern for scheduling with function auth/signature
* Apollo polling vs subscriptions for notification & updates

---

# Ideas for how?

* Webhooks? Like Netlify does on deploy, forms, identity?
* Send back stats (stats, duration)
* Support pluggable log service & client (Pino, Logflare)
* Add Prisma upsert to "CRUUD" generators
* RedwoodJS IDE filter `-background.js` functions as "jobs"

---

# üçæ How did RedwoodJS make it possible?

* üß† Framework
* üåü Sides (web and api)
*  Services w/in api
* ü•° Functions effectively became "jobs" side
* SDL & GraphQL w/ Cells made Charts a snap
* Needs a name!
