Blake Gray | Posted Sunday, 13-Sep-2020</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<p>It took more than 1000 years to identify in Tuscany the viticultural traces of religious pilgrims hiking from Spain to Rome to visit the Pope. Today you can drink a bottle of wine that would not exist without those pilgrims.</p>\n<p>It nearly didn't exist, though. The village of San Miniato made cheap Chianti from the Spanish grapes for centuries without knowing what they were, and without caring either, because in low-end wine all the grapes were fermented together.</p>\n\n<p>Sangiovese dominated &#8211; it's <a href=\"https://bit.ly/regions-tuscany\">Tuscany</a>&#160;&#8211; but another variety that the locals called \"X\" went in the vat and was barely noticeable in the mix.</p>\n<p>That's one of Tempranillo's characteristics, as we have learned in the 21st Century. Tempranillo plays second-fiddle when blended with Cabernet or Merlot, as increasingly happens in southern <a href=\"https://bit.ly/regions-spain\">Spain</a> today. Though it is by far the most important grape in Spain, Tempranillo needs to be on its own to be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Though it has grown there for centuries, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/grape-483-tempranillo\">Tempranillo</a> might not have kept its tiny foothold in Tuscan wine if not for Leonardo Beconcini. And the irony is he found it while looking for the best clones of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/grape-432-sangiovese\">Sangiovese</a>. A different, less-curious vigneron might have just grafted the X vines to Sangiovese, especially because the X vines on his farm were old and, therefore, producing a small crop. But Beconcini knew that was what made them interesting.</p>\n<p>\"We have ungrafted, pre-phylloxera Tempranillo vines on our property,\" Beconcini told Wine-Searcher. \"It's a very particular present from our land.\"</p>\n<h2>Listen up, pilgrim</h2>\n<p>San Miniato was a key stop on the \"Via Francigena\", a road that pilgrims took through France from England to the north and Spain to the west. It sits at the intersection of the Florence-Pisa and Lucca-Siena roads, and was an important trading post for centuries. That's probably how the Tempranillo got there.</p>\n<p>\"San Miniato was a very important town on this route,\" Beconcini said. \"We think a community of people started this particular growing with the Tempranillo seeds. They couldn't carry the vines all that way so they would carry the seeds. We are not sure for this, but it is the most logical.\"</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, San Miniato's economic peak may have been during the pilgrimage era. Wine-wise, it is on the wrong side of Florence, to the west about halfway to the Ligurian Sea. When the Grand Duke of Tuscany issued an edict in 1716 about who could produce <a href=\"https://bit.ly/regions-chianti\">Chianti</a>, San Miniato and its neighbors were left out. More than 200 years later, the Grand Duke's preferred villages south and east of Florence formed the basis of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/regions-chianti+classico\">Chianti Classico</a>.</p>\n<p>Italy being Italy, that didn't stop anyone from making Chianti: laws gradually loosened to allow Chianti production over an enormous swath of Tuscany. But the fortunes of Chianti Classico and greater Chianti have diverged; it's hard to make a living now making Chianti because Italians won't pay much for it.</p>\n<p>Beconcini's grandfather Pietro was a sharecropper in San Miniato, but he managed to save up enough money to buy the land he worked as a typical Italian farm with vegetables, olive trees, animals and of course grapevines.</p>\n<p>\"In the past, the first goal was to obtain food for the family, and after sell a part,\" Beconcini said.</p>\n<p>Beconcini's father changed the focus of the farm to just making wine, but he was making cheap jug wine like all the other farmers in the non-heralded parts of greater Chianti.</p>\n<p>\"My father make just one kind of wine, just simple Chianti,\" Beconcini said. \"For all the life, my father, one wine.\"</p>\n<p>In 1990, Leonardo Beconcini took over the farm at age 26. He has good soils and knew it: white clay with fossil shells. And he had the old vines. But he clashed with his father right away.</p>\n<p>\"I wanted to use Sangiovese from San Miniato for obtain better wine,\" Beconcini said. \"San Miniato is not Montalcino, Greve in Chianti, Bolgheri or another famous land in Tuscany. In San Miniato, I am the first winemaker to try to start make wine at a more high level. They have not experience in San Miniato. In the past I traveled in France, I see the farmer who has the winery. I see the farmer make wine. My family was very different. They want to stop me. But it was very very important in the '90s. We needed to develop. The mass production was finished for a small farm. Consumers drink less wine but more important wine. Our clients asked us for another kind of wine. I am young but I travel and I see around the world. My family, no.\"</p>\n<p>    \t                        </p>\r\n<span>&#169; Peter Beconcini</span><p>\r\n|\r\n</p><span>Apart from the IXE, Beconcini produces more typical Tuscan wines, too.</span>\r\n\n<h2>Learning the hard way</h2>\n<p>One of the first things he did was start a research project with University of Florence to identify the best Sangiovese on his land. He was also curious about the X vine, and he had a lot of it, but until DNA testing in 2004, he didn't know what it was. Once he learned its identity, Beconcini traveled to Spain to learn more about Tempranillo. One thing he discovered is that he didn't like most of the Spanish wines made from it.</p>\n<p>\"Learning is very difficult for us,\" Beconicini said. \"The winemaker in Spain is working in a very different style than in Tuscany. For us, it's very important the freshness, the balance. The wine going with food. We want to have a more food wine than the wine in Spain. In Spain, the grape is the same, the vine is the same, but there's a different method. Tempranillo vines can obtain very high sugar content, and very high concentration. I travel in Spain for understand the vines, but we want to make a Tuscan wine.\"</p>\n<p>In that, he has succeeded. The most remarkable thing about <a href=\"https://bit.ly/find/peter+beconcini+ixe+tempranillo+tuscany+igp+italy\">Pietro Beconcini IXE Toscana Tempranillo</a> is the freshness. You won't taste many Spanish Tempranillos with this much acidity. It has nice red plum fruit, but I felt in drinking the 2016 this summer that I was robbing the cradle.</p>\n<p>\"We make harvest in the balance moment, when we have a good quantity of sugar, but still acidity,\" Beconcini said. \"We make vinification with long maceration on the skins. No fast vinification. Our project is for obtain spices, colors, freshness from the grapes and freshness and minerality from our soil. It's possible to drink also new but for our style it's okay to age. The tannins are very present and the acidity is very high. We want to make a Tuscan Tempranillo.\"</p>\n<p>Today the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/merchant/54180\">Pietro Beconcini</a> winery makes about 9000 cases of wine a year and Tempranillo is fully 30 percent of that, making it a very unique Tuscan winery.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Beconcini joined the consortium of the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/m/2020/05/clean-power-of-pisa-trumps-chianti\">Terre di Pisa appellation</a>. Because generic Chianti fetches such a low price, he had been simply calling his wines Wine of Tuscany.</p>\n<p>\"For me the Terre di Pisa DOC is very important for promote the location,\" Beconcini said. \"Because our Sangiovese is not the same as the Chianti Classico, but the soil makes it possible to make a different Sangiovese but very recognized.\"</p>\n<p>But he won't be able to call his Tempranillo wine Terre di Pisa, because it's not an Italian grape. However, bear with me now for wine grape variety geekiness.</p>\n<p>Beconcini makes a very interesting wine called <a href=\"https://bit.ly/find/peter+beconcini+maurleo+tuscany+igp+italy\">Maurleo</a> that is 50 percent Sangiovese and 50 percent <a href=\"https://bit.ly/grape-265-malvasia-nera\">Malvasia Nera</a>. It's the most interesting wine I've tasted in his portfolio, with an intense character of cherry, tobacco and a hint of jackfruit. The tropical note of jackfruit must come from the Malvasia Nera because I've never tasted it in Sangiovese or in Tempranillo, and Malvasia grapes are known for being aromatic. That said, wine geneticist Jos&#233; Vouillamoz claims in the book Wine Grapes that in Tuscany \"a few old vines of the Spanish variety Tempranillo have been found under the misleading name Malvasia Nera\".</p>\n<p>I'm not a geneticist so I can't resolve that conflict, but I can report that because Malvasia Nera is considered a native grape while Tempranillo is not, Beconcini can and will label Maurleo as a Terre di Pisa Rosso DOC wine from the 2018 vintage.</p>\n<p>\"It's a combination very traditional in our land,\" Beconcini said. \"A lot of years ago when I project this wine, I study our terroir and I see a very important percentage in our vineyards of Malvasia Nera. I try together with Sangiovese. I search for a good companion for Sangiovese for make my second wine. I think a soft grape, more enjoyable, more simple grape. In my winery, I don't use international grapes. Never. I haven't Cabernet, Syrah or so on.\"</p>\n<p>But he does have Tempranillo. And that's a tale as old as the pilgrims.</p>    \t      \t\r\n</div>\t\r\n</div></div></body></html>"

Blake Gray | Posted Sunday, 13-Sep-2020</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<p>It took more than 1000 years to identify in Tuscany the viticultural traces of religious pilgrims hiking from Spain to Rome to visit the Pope. Today you can drink a bottle of wine that would not exist without those pilgrims.</p>\n<p>It nearly didn't exist, though. The village of San Miniato made cheap Chianti from the Spanish grapes for centuries without knowing what they were, and without caring either, because in low-end wine all the grapes were fermented together.</p>\n\n<p>Sangiovese dominated &#8211; it's <a href=\"https://bit.ly/regions-tuscany\">Tuscany</a>&#160;&#8211; but another variety that the locals called \"X\" went in the vat and was barely noticeable in the mix.</p>\n<p>That's one of Tempranillo's characteristics, as we have learned in the 21st Century. Tempranillo plays second-fiddle when blended with Cabernet or Merlot, as increasingly happens in southern <a href=\"https://bit.ly/regions-spain\">Spain</a> today. Though it is by far the most important grape in Spain, Tempranillo needs to be on its own to be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Though it has grown there for centuries, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/grape-483-tempranillo\">Tempranillo</a> might not have kept its tiny foothold in Tuscan wine if not for Leonardo Beconcini. And the irony is he found it while looking for the best clones of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/grape-432-sangiovese\">Sangiovese</a>. A different, less-curious vigneron might have just grafted the X vines to Sangiovese, especially because the X vines on his farm were old and, therefore, producing a small crop. But Beconcini knew that was what made them interesting.</p>\n<p>\"We have ungrafted, pre-phylloxera Tempranillo vines on our property,\" Beconcini told Wine-Searcher. \"It's a very particular present from our land.\"</p>\n<h2>Listen up, pilgrim</h2>\n<p>San Miniato was a key stop on the \"Via Francigena\", a road that pilgrims took through France from England to the north and Spain to the west. It sits at the intersection of the Florence-Pisa and Lucca-Siena roads, and was an important trading post for centuries. That's probably how the Tempranillo got there.</p>\n<p>\"San Miniato was a very important town on this route,\" Beconcini said. \"We think a community of people started this particular growing with the Tempranillo seeds. They couldn't carry the vines all that way so they would carry the seeds. We are not sure for this, but it is the most logical.\"</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, San Miniato's economic peak may have been during the pilgrimage era. Wine-wise, it is on the wrong side of Florence, to the west about halfway to the Ligurian Sea. When the Grand Duke of Tuscany issued an edict in 1716 about who could produce <a href=\"https://bit.ly/regions-chianti\">Chianti</a>, San Miniato and its neighbors were left out. More than 200 years later, the Grand Duke's preferred villages south and east of Florence formed the basis of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/regions-chianti+classico\">Chianti Classico</a>.</p>\n<p>Italy being Italy, that didn't stop anyone from making Chianti: laws gradually loosened to allow Chianti production over an enormous swath of Tuscany. But the fortunes of Chianti Classico and greater Chianti have diverged; it's hard to make a living now making Chianti because Italians won't pay much for it.</p>\n<p>Beconcini's grandfather Pietro was a sharecropper in San Miniato, but he managed to save up enough money to buy the land he worked as a typical Italian farm with vegetables, olive trees, animals and of course grapevines.</p>\n<p>\"In the past, the first goal was to obtain food for the family, and after sell a part,\" Beconcini said.</p>\n<p>Beconcini's father changed the focus of the farm to just making wine, but he was making cheap jug wine like all the other farmers in the non-heralded parts of greater Chianti.</p>\n<p>\"My father make just one kind of wine, just simple Chianti,\" Beconcini said. \"For all the life, my father, one wine.\"</p>\n<p>In 1990, Leonardo Beconcini took over the farm at age 26. He has good soils and knew it: white clay with fossil shells. And he had the old vines. But he clashed with his father right away.</p>\n<p>\"I wanted to use Sangiovese from San Miniato for obtain better wine,\" Beconcini said. \"San Miniato is not Montalcino, Greve in Chianti, Bolgheri or another famous land in Tuscany. In San Miniato, I am the first winemaker to try to start make wine at a more high level. They have not experience in San Miniato. In the past I traveled in France, I see the farmer who has the winery. I see the farmer make wine. My family was very different. They want to stop me. But it was very very important in the '90s. We needed to develop. The mass production was finished for a small farm. Consumers drink less wine but more important wine. Our clients asked us for another kind of wine. I am young but I travel and I see around the world. My family, no.\"</p>\n<p>    \t                        </p>\r\n<span>&#169; Peter Beconcini</span><p>\r\n|\r\n</p><span>Apart from the IXE, Beconcini produces more typical Tuscan wines, too.</span>\r\n\n<h2>Learning the hard way</h2>\n<p>One of the first things he did was start a research project with University of Florence to identify the best Sangiovese on his land. He was also curious about the X vine, and he had a lot of it, but until DNA testing in 2004, he didn't know what it was. Once he learned its identity, Beconcini traveled to Spain to learn more about Tempranillo. One thing he discovered is that he didn't like most of the Spanish wines made from it.</p>\n<p>\"Learning is very difficult for us,\" Beconicini said. \"The winemaker in Spain is working in a very different style than in Tuscany. For us, it's very important the freshness, the balance. The wine going with food. We want to have a more food wine than the wine in Spain. In Spain, the grape is the same, the vine is the same, but there's a different method. Tempranillo vines can obtain very high sugar content, and very high concentration. I travel in Spain for understand the vines, but we want to make a Tuscan wine.\"</p>\n<p>In that, he has succeeded. The most remarkable thing about <a href=\"https://bit.ly/find/peter+beconcini+ixe+tempranillo+tuscany+igp+italy\">Pietro Beconcini IXE Toscana Tempranillo</a> is the freshness. You won't taste many Spanish Tempranillos with this much acidity. It has nice red plum fruit, but I felt in drinking the 2016 this summer that I was robbing the cradle.</p>\n<p>\"We make harvest in the balance moment, when we have a good quantity of sugar, but still acidity,\" Beconcini said. \"We make vinification with long maceration on the skins. No fast vinification. Our project is for obtain spices, colors, freshness from the grapes and freshness and minerality from our soil. It's possible to drink also new but for our style it's okay to age. The tannins are very present and the acidity is very high. We want to make a Tuscan Tempranillo.\"</p>\n<p>Today the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/merchant/54180\">Pietro Beconcini</a> winery makes about 9000 cases of wine a year and Tempranillo is fully 30 percent of that, making it a very unique Tuscan winery.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Beconcini joined the consortium of the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/m/2020/05/clean-power-of-pisa-trumps-chianti\">Terre di Pisa appellation</a>. Because generic Chianti fetches such a low price, he had been simply calling his wines Wine of Tuscany.</p>\n<p>\"For me the Terre di Pisa DOC is very important for promote the location,\" Beconcini said. \"Because our Sangiovese is not the same as the Chianti Classico, but the soil makes it possible to make a different Sangiovese but very recognized.\"</p>\n<p>But he won't be able to call his Tempranillo wine Terre di Pisa, because it's not an Italian grape. However, bear with me now for wine grape variety geekiness.</p>\n<p>Beconcini makes a very interesting wine called <a href=\"https://bit.ly/find/peter+beconcini+maurleo+tuscany+igp+italy\">Maurleo</a> that is 50 percent Sangiovese and 50 percent <a href=\"https://bit.ly/grape-265-malvasia-nera\">Malvasia Nera</a>. It's the most interesting wine I've tasted in his portfolio, with an intense character of cherry, tobacco and a hint of jackfruit. The tropical note of jackfruit must come from the Malvasia Nera because I've never tasted it in Sangiovese or in Tempranillo, and Malvasia grapes are known for being aromatic. That said, wine geneticist Jos&#233; Vouillamoz claims in the book Wine Grapes that in Tuscany \"a few old vines of the Spanish variety Tempranillo have been found under the misleading name Malvasia Nera\".</p>\n<p>I'm not a geneticist so I can't resolve that conflict, but I can report that because Malvasia Nera is considered a native grape while Tempranillo is not, Beconcini can and will label Maurleo as a Terre di Pisa Rosso DOC wine from the 2018 vintage.</p>\n<p>\"It's a combination very traditional in our land,\" Beconcini said. \"A lot of years ago when I project this wine, I study our terroir and I see a very important percentage in our vineyards of Malvasia Nera. I try together with Sangiovese. I search for a good companion for Sangiovese for make my second wine. I think a soft grape, more enjoyable, more simple grape. In my winery, I don't use international grapes. Never. I haven't Cabernet, Syrah or so on.\"</p>\n<p>But he does have Tempranillo. And that's a tale as old as the pilgrims.</p>    \t      \t\r\n</div>\t\r\n</div></div></body></html>"

Classifications range from the youngest (VS) to older expressions such as VSOP and XO.</span></p>\n<p><span>More than 200 million bottles of Cognac are sold every year, 98% of them outside France. Cognac is a versatile spirit that can be consumed in simple mixed drinks, in an array of cocktails, or sipped on its own.</span></p>\n<h3>Who makes Cognac?</h3>\n<ul><li><span>Winegrowers: Numbering well over 4,000, they mainly sell their wine to distillers, but some bottle their own Cognac.</span></li>\n<li><span>Professional distillers: They buy wines, distil and sell them &#8211; or custom-distil them for other producers.</span></li>\n<li><span>N&#233;gociants: Some 280 Cognac houses buy wines to distil, unaged eaux-de-vie, or casks of mature Cognac. These include Hennessy, Martell, R&#233;my Martin and Courvoisier, who together account for about 85% of global Cognac sales.</span></li>\n</ul><p></p>\n<h3>Where is Cognac made?</h3>\n<p><span>There are about 78,000ha of vineyards in Cognac, stretching from just above Bordeaux to as far north as La Rochelle, and eastwards from the Atlantic to beyond Angoul&#234;me. The vineyards are split into six zones or crus:</span></p>\n<ul><li><span>Grande Champagne: The most prized, with deep, crumbly chalk soils and located to the south of the Charente river. Produces floral, fine-toned eaux-de-vie that benefit from long ageing.</span></li>\n<li><span>Petite Champagne: Surrounding Grande Champagne, with less-crumbly chalk soils and a more oceanic climate. Produces floral, lightly fruity Cognacs.</span></li>\n<li><span>Borderies: A small enclave north of the Charente. It has less chalk, producing aromatic but faster-ageing Cognacs.</span></li>\n<li><span>Fins Bois: The largest cru, Fins Bois surrounds the first three, and has mostly thin clay/limestone soils. Produces fruity, faster-maturing Cognacs.</span></li>\n<li><span>Bons Bois: A varied cru surrounding Fins Bois, with a number of different soil and climate types.</span></li>\n<li><span>Bois Ordinaires/Bois &#224; Terroirs: Covering the Atlantic coast and the Ile d&#8217;Ol&#233;ron and Ile de R&#233;. Unsurprisingly, it has a strong oceanic influence.</span></li>\n</ul><h3>What grape varieties go into Cognac?</h3>\n<p><span>There are six permitted grape varieties in Cognac:</span></p>\n\n<ul><li><span>Ugni Blanc: Covering 98% of Cognac&#8217;s vineyards, and prized for its resistance to disease, its high acidity and low sugar levels. Produces a light, neutral and acidic wine (typically 8%-9% abv), ideally suited to distillation and ageing.</span></li>\n<li><span>Folle Blanche: Historically Cognac&#8217;s dominant variety, it has fallen from favour because of its sensitivity to rot when grafted. Now covers less than 1% of the vineyard, producing aromatic and well-balanced Cognacs.</span></li>\n<li><span>Folignan: A new cross of Ugni Blanc and Folle Blanche, with an aromatic character. Can only make up 10% of a blend.</span></li>\n<li><span>The other varieties &#8211; Colombard, Montils and S&#233;millon &#8211; are insignificant.</span></li>\n</ul><h3>How is Cognac made?</h3>\n<h3><span>Winemaking</span></h3>\n<p><span>The harvest &#8211; usually carried out by machine &#8211; lasts from about mid-September to mid-October, with conventional vinification giving a highly acidic wine of around 9% abv. No sugar or sulphites can be added.</span></p>\n\n<h3><span>Distillation</span></h3>\n<p><span>This must be completed by 31 March following the harvest, and comprises a small-batch, double distillation in a Charentais copper pot still. Some producers distil &#8216;on the lees&#8217;, including the dead yeast and pulp from the winemaking process, to give a more complex spirit character.</span></p>\n<p><span>The process is as follows:</span></p>\n\n<ul><li>\n<span>The first </span><i><span>chauffe</span></i><span> or distillation creates the first distillate, the </span><i><span>brouillis</span></i><span>, with a strength of roughly 28%-32% abv.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>The second </span><i><span>chauffe</span></i><span> &#8211; sometimes called </span><i><span>repasse</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>bonne chauffe</span></i><span> &#8211; distils the </span><i><span>brouillis</span></i><span>, creating an eau-de-vie of around 70%-72% abv, once the &#8216;heads&#8217; and &#8216;tails&#8217; from the start and end of the spirit run are eliminated. These can be redistilled with the next batch.</span>\n</li>\n</ul><h3><span>Maturation</span></h3>\n<p><span>Cognac must be matured in oak barrels for at least two years prior to release, but is often aged for much longer. Many factors influence the character of the maturing eau-de-vie, including:</span></p>\n<ul><li><span>oak origin (usually Tron&#231;ais or Limousin forests)</span></li>\n<li><span>grain width</span></li>\n<li><span>age of barrel (younger casks give more flavour, but decades-old barrels have little or no influence beyond the processes of evaporation and micro-oxygenation)</span></li>\n<li><span>warehouse and barrel location. Cognac cellar masters use a variety of cellar types &#8211; some drier, some more humid, some cooler and some warmer. Eaux-de-vie maturing in humid cellars lose more alcohol than water, while those ageing in drier cellars lose more water than alcohol. This influences spirit strength and style.</span></li>\n</ul><h3><span>Blending</span></h3>\n<p><span>The vast majority of Cognacs are blends, composed by the cellar master from eaux-de-vie of various ages and origins to create a Cognac that is balanced, complex and consistent. Distilled water is added to dilute to the desired strength, which is usually 40% abv.</span></p>\n<h3>Cognac classifications</h3>\n<p><span>Cognac must be matured for at least two years before bottling, and must have a strength of at least 40% abv. Classifications include:</span></p>\n<ul><li><span>VS: At least two years old. More than half the Cognac sold in the world is VS.</span></li>\n<li><span>VSOP: At least four years old. Just over one-third of global Cognac sales are VSOP.</span></li>\n<li><span>XO: At least 10 years old.</span></li>\n<li><span>XXO: At least 14 years old.</span></li>\n</ul><p><span>Other classifications are as follows:</span></p>\n<ul><li><span>Aged for at least three years: Sup&#233;rieur, Cuv&#233;e Sup&#233;rieure or Qualit&#233; Sup&#233;rieure.</span></li>\n<li><span>Aged for at least five years: Vieille R&#233;serve, R&#233;serve Rare or R&#233;serve Royale.</span></li>\n<li><span>Aged for at least six years: Napol&#233;on, Tr&#232;s Vieille R&#233;serve, Tr&#232;s Vieux, H&#233;ritage, Tr&#232;s Rare, Excellence or Supr&#234;me.</span></li>\n</ul><p><span>If a cru is named on the label &#8211; Grande Champagne, for example &#8211; then the Cognac must be 100% from that cru. &#8216;Fine Champagne&#8217; designates a Cognac blended from Grande and Petite Champagne, with at least 50% from Grande Champagne.</span></p>\n<p><span>Vintage Cognacs &#8211; bottled by specialists such as Hine, Frapin and Delamain &#8211; must be 100% from the year named.</span></p>\n<h3>How to drink Cognac</h3>\n<p><span>Most Cognac in the world is drunk mixed &#8211; with water, over ice, or with mixers including soda, lemonade and cola.</span></p>\n<p><span>Cognac also has a long heritage in cocktails, with classics including the Sidecar, Vieux Carr&#233; and Horse&#8217;s Neck.</span></p>\n<p><span>The finer Cognacs &#8211; XO and above, plus vintages &#8211; are usually consumed neat to fully appreciate their complexity and character. A stemmed tulip-shaped glass is the best vessel from which to savour Cognac&#8217;s aromas and flavours.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.decanter.com/wp-content/themes/simba-theme/assets/images/placeholder.png\" alt=\"Cognac bottles\"></p>\n<h3>Top Cognacs: eight names to know</h3>\n<h3><span>Hennessy</span></h3>\n<p><span>The largest producer by far. It has a rich, sometimes woody style, ascending from VS through VSOP and XO to high-end expressions such as Paradis and Richard Hennessy.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Martell</span></h3>\n<p><span>Tending towards purity and fruit expression, thanks to Martell&#8217;s insistence on distilling clear wines only. Traditionally a user of the small Borderies cru.</span></p>\n<h3><span>R&#233;my Martin</span></h3>\n<p><span>Exclusively sources from Grande and Petite Champagne, specialising in VSOP and above.

I&#8217;ve never seen a relatively flat &#8220;sprint&#8221; stage turn into an all out tactical battle for the green jersey! Since Peter Sagan rode his first Tour back in 2012, the points competition has never been a contest. In fact, he&#8217;s won it every time he&#8217;s completed the race, for a total of seven wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://theswirlingdervish.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/bicycling-site.jpg?w=980\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10609\"><figcaption>Peter Sagan tries to break the competition (photo: <a href=\"http://www.Bicycling.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.Bicycling.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>While I love watching him dominate the fast dashes to the finish, I&#8217;ve gotta admit that it&#8217;s fun knowing that this year it&#8217;s up for grabs. Sam Bennett has held the jersey for a few days and seems poised to keep it a bit longer, depending on whether team Bora-Hansgrohe&#8217;s strategy pays off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saturday, Bora took charge of the race almost from the gun. Their <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/tour-de-france/a33994549/tour-de-france-2020-stage-14/\">mission</a>? Maintain a breath-takingly fast pace over the few climbs along the way, leaving the sprinters &#8211; especially Sam Bennett &#8211; gasping for air. At one point the commentators announced that the expected finish time for the stage was 10 minutes earlier than the fastest projection. These guys were hauling ass, trying to set Sagan up for a stage win (and 50 points).</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-10598\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>Was it successful? In part. Bennett and the other green jersey contenders were dropped, gaining no points. But Sagan had a few challengers for the stage win, ultimately coming in fourth (for 17 points.) So he cut into Bennett&#8217;s advantage but maybe not enough to warrant the exhaustion of all his guys. Time will tell whether it was genius or madness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But can I say again how fun this is? In all my years as a fan, I&#8217;ve never seen an entire team unified around the strategy of taking the green jersey. Usually, the energy would go to support the GC contender but Bora lost theirs earlier in the race. They have nothing to lose by devoting all their energy to the sprint competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoever wins in the end, I&#8217;m going to savor every battle fought from now until we arrive in Paris. Wouldn&#8217;t it be dramatic if the jersey were decided by the final sprint on the Champs-Elys&#233;es?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"></figure><p><strong>What&#8217;s on Order for Stage 15</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The peloton heads east from Lyon, to the Alps, where the riders will face the daunting HC ascent up the Grand Colombier &#8211; almost 5,000 feet of climbing. At the end of the race. After having climbed two category 1 mountains. It&#8217;s sure to be a day of pain, given the competitive pace of the last few &#8220;easy&#8221; stages, and the riders will most certainly be dreaming of the rest day on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://theswirlingdervish.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/stage-15-map.jpg?w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10600\"><figcaption>Stage map from <a href=\"http://www.letour.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.letour.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>The sprint points are on offer early, and there should be an all-out brawl to be at the front of the pack. It will be Bora-Hansgrohe vs Deceuninck going full gas, trying to place Sagan and Bennett in position to win. Expect other opportunists like Matteo Trentin, Caleb Ewan, and Elia Viviani to be in the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the GC battle, this stage will expose whoever&#8217;s weak: any gaps at the finish could elevate an ambitious rider to a higher placement overall, or relegate someone who can&#8217;t respond to an attack. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing who prevails at the end of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sad note for fans of Romain Bardet: he crashed on Friday but was able to finish the race. Unfortunately, he was later diagnosed with a concussion as a result of that fall, and withdrew from the Tour. He was the best hope for the French, in fourth place overall when he abandoned, and he&#8217;d have done well in the Alps. Best of luck, Romain. Maybe we&#8217;ll see you in the Vuelta?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Renardat-F&#226;che Cerdon du Bugey M&#233;thode Ancestrale</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we are pedaling through the Savoie wine region, it&#8217;s only right that we sip a local wine from the Cerdon du Bugey AOC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elie and Christelle <a href=\"http://www.renardat-fache.com/\">Renardat-F&#226;che</a> represent the eighth generation to farm this small patch (12.5 hectares) in the foothills of the Alps. They make just one wine: Cerdon du Bugey, a sparkling ros&#233; based on Gamay and the indigenous Poulsard, made according to the <a href=\"https://winefolly.com/deep-dive/how-sparkling-wine-is-made/#:~:text=%20Traditional%20Method%20%201%20Base%20Wine%20or,1.3%25%20more%20alcohol%20and%20the%20process...%20More%20\">ancestral method</a>, which results in a slightly fizzy, slightly sweet wine. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://theswirlingdervish.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/harvest-renardat-fache-bugey.jpg?w=720\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10604\"><figcaption>Harvest at Renardat-F&#226;che (winery photo)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Vineyards have been certified organic since 2011, and the couple have introduced some biodynamic preparations and methods as well. Grapes are hand-harvested and undergo spontaneous fermentation over several weeks. Fermentation is arrested (via cold temperatures) when the wine has reached 7.5-8% alcohol by volume, and rests on its lees for at least two months. The wine is then emptied into tanks to remove the lees, and rebottled, always in the month of December.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://theswirlingdervish.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/vineyard_0-renardat-fache.png?w=720\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10613\"><figcaption>Looking through the vineyards (winery photo)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The blend is 70% Gamay and 30% Poulsard, with bright berry aromas and a slightly sweet palate. It&#8217;s color is pale, bright pink and seems to suggest a celebration. I think we should toast to our favorite sprinters: they have a long road ahead of them on Sunday, but there will be glory for one of them at kilometer 58.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://theswirlingdervish.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/bugey-cerdon-shot-from-renardat-fache-fb-page.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10606\"><figcaption>Cerdon du Bugey from Renardat-F&#226;che (winery photo)</figcaption></figure><p>Enjoy our first foray into the Alps, and get ready for some drama.

Was a four-hour road trip worth a 25-minute tasting session?</p>\n<p>It was the last day of a weeklong visit to my home state, <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/region/california/\">California</a>. By 5 pm the next day, I would be back in the Big Apple.</p>\n<p>The idea of a train, two buses and an Uber once I arrived in <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/region/napa-valley/\">Napa</a>,&#8239;all for a short wine tasting at someone&#8217;s house, was daunting.&#8239;But a member of the <a href=\"https://www.mastersommeliers.org/\">Court of Master Sommeliers</a> had helped me set up this meeting, so I went.</p>\n<p>Andrea Robinson, MS, greeted me with huge, bubbly energy that was contagious. I peered behind her and noted an arch of six wines on her table.</p>\n<p>After we rushed through introductions, Andrea asked what brought me here.</p>\n<p>I paused. I felt I would be complaining if I said that many of my emails and phone calls to Master Sommeliers in New York City went unanswered. Access to a Master Sommelier, though, was imperative to ensure that I could assess wines at the level the Court required for Advanced and Master certifications.</p>\n\n<p>I had participated in myriad tasting groups. Often times, though, there was great conflict: Is the acid medium plus or high? Is the body medium-plus or full? Is the fruit baked or jammy? Is the brighter fruit possibly an indication of vintage or climate?</p>\n<p>The sum total of these subtle distinctions not only builds the profile of a wine, but helps me, as a <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/2019/11/05/sommelier-school-tips/\">sommelier</a> working the floor, make a recommendation for a guest.</p>\n<p>I put my thoughts aside and said, &#8220;I would really like to work on palate descriptors and my structure calls.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Great,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And it is great to see a woman of color, as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We then recreated the conditions of the verbal portion of the exam. She recited the instructions, I hit record on my phone and I&#8239;was off. Wine No. 1: We have a clear <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/2011/03/16/white-wine-basics/\">white wine</a> of moderate concentration&#8230;</p>\n<p>When she revealed what I had tasted, Andrea was deliberate and sensitive in her criticism. If I made an incorrect assertion, she pulled out a bottle of the variety I had called, and we compared the two. When my descriptors were vague, she rummaged around to find food equivalents, so I could flesh out my vocabulary. She offered such a safe space to explore, I savored every minute.</p>\n<p>In that moment, I had gratitude. I realized every mentorship opportunity is worth seeking out.</p>\n<p>As I was leaving, Andrea gave me a big hug and said, nonchalantly, &#8220;If you ever come out to Napa to do a harvest and need a place to stay, we have a guest house available. No charge.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I looked at her skeptically, and she politely interrupted, &#8220;No, really, I mean it.&#8221;</p>\n</div>\n                        \n                        <div><p>Published on September 13, 2020</p></div>\n                                                                            \n                                                </div></div></body></html>"

The latter offers creamy yet chiseled and well-defined expressions of place, and is considered the benchmark for where the grape reaches its greatest heights.</p>\n<p>But Chardonnay country extends even farther, to the C&#244;te Chalonnaise and the M&#226;connais in southern Burgundy, where it yields profound wines from near identical soils that exemplify great value.</p>\n<p>In that roughly 60-mile stretch from the most northerly vineyards in Chablis to the southernmost in Pouilly-Fuiss&#233;, fruit expression changes according to ripeness. Notes of yellow citrus, green apple and pear are common in northern pours, while more southerly expressions can present riper examples of apple and pear that venture toward Mirabelle plum, peach and even melon.</p>\n<p>White Burgundy is especially prized for its ability to reflect a sense of place.</p>\n<p>For more than a thousand years, generations of growers developed an intimate knowledge of each site. They traced minute changes in the soils which help explain the existing patchwork of single vineyards.</p>\n<p>Burgundy sits on a Jurassic ridge of a former seabed that created various layers of limestone. These layers are mixed with clay, which, along with aspect and altitude, constitute the variations between sites.</p>\n<p>To understand the differences between all the single vineyards can be confusing. The labels in Burgundy, however, are quite straightforward. Bottles are distinguished as regional, village or single-vineyard wines. Regional appellations like Bourgogne Blanc are the simplest wines, but they can represent great value.</p>\n<p>Village appellations are graded into wines that carry either a collective village name or single-vineyard, either a <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/2019/07/16/what-is-a-cru/\">premier cru (first growth) or grand cru (great growth)</a>, designation. Chablis and all the villages of the C&#244;te d&#8217;Or work this way. Some villages have reputations for certain characteristics, such as the sculpted precision of Chassagne-Montrachet and Puligny-Montrachet, or the creamy richness of Meursault.</p>\n<p>The Grands Crus of Montrachet and Corton are considerd the pinnacle of white Burgundy. Capable of maturing for decades, these wines command serious price tags.</p>\n<p>The Premiers Crus of Rully and Montagny in the C&#244;te Chalonnaise, or village appellations in the M&#226;connais, like Pouilly-Fuiss&#233;, Saint-V&#233;ran and Vir&#233;-Cless&#233;, bring structure and depth at more affordable prices. <em>&#8212;Anne Krebiehl, MW</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Recommended Wines from Burgundy</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/vincent-girardin-2016-corton-charlemagne/\">Vincent Girardin 2016 Corton-Charlemagne</a></strong>; $239, 95 points. <em>Cellar Selection</em>.

Becky Wasserman Selections.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>California &#8211; Napa/Sonoma</strong></h2>\n<p>Chardonnay&#8217;s meteoric rise in America can be traced to the vision and winemaking of several Napa and Sonoma minds, like Fred McCrea, Mike Grgich, Richard Arrowood and Jess Jackson.</p>\n<p>The 1952 Stony Hill Chardonnay is often considered one of the first modern Napa Valley cult wines. But think about this: When the McCreas planted Chardonnay from Wente cuttings on their Spring Mountain estate in the 1940s, the grape didn&#8217;t exist in the Napa Valley.</p>\n<p>Stony Hill&#8217;s appeal was its hands-off style, which incorporated no <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/2019/09/24/how-white-wine-is-made/\">malolactic fermentation</a> or new oak. It represented a leaner, more elegant style that&#8217;s finally coming back into vogue. Along with Chateau Montelena and Mayacamas, the winery was among the first producers to prove Chardonnay from Napa and Sonoma could be world-class in style and pedigree.</p>\n<p>Thirty years later, Kendall-Jackson&#8217;s Vintner&#8217;s Reserve would popularize it beyond anyone&#8217;s wildest dreams. The bottling remains the top-selling wine in America today.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a somewhat confusing category, at once capable of being the most memorable wine you&#8217;ve ever had and a clich&#233;.</p>\n<p>While still wildly popular, Chardonnay in Napa and Sonoma trends more specialized and site-specific. Grape growers and winemakers now give it the same thought and scrupulous attention once reserved for Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, like with <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/varietals/pinot-noir/\">Pinot Noir</a>, this means to search for cooler climates that better coax out the white wine&#8217;s savory and quenching aspects of minerality, salinity and acidity. Often, these have been marred by too much ripeness or oak.</p>\n<p>Such effort shows in some of our favorite selections, which come from relatively cool sites and small producers. Additional names to look for include Ramey Wine Cellars, Kistler Vineyards, Gary Farrell Vineyards &amp; Winery, J. Rochioli Vineyards &amp; Winery, Hanzell Vineyards, Donum, Wayfarer, Hartford Court, Benovia, LaRue and Arista. Single-vineyard designates from Hyde Estate Winery, Hudson Ranch or Ritchie Vineyard are also well worth seeking. <em>&#8212;Virginie Boone</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Recommended Wines from Napa/Sonoma</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lynmar-estate-2017-susannas-vineyard-chardonnay-sonoma-coast/\">Lynmar Estate 2017 Susanna&#8217;s Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)</a></strong>; $60, 96 points.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/mayacamas-2017-chardonnay-mount-veeder/\"><strong>Mayacamas 2017 Chardonnay (Mount Veeder)</strong></a><strong>;</strong> $50, 95 points. <em>Editors&#8217; Choice</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/dumol-2017-wester-reach-chardonnay-russian-river-valley/\"><strong>DuMol 2017 Wester Reach Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)</strong></a>; $56, 94 points.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/dutton-goldfield-2017-rued-vineyard-chardonnay-green-valley/\"><strong>Dutton-Goldfield 2017 Rued Vineyard Chardonnay (Green Valley)</strong></a>; $55, 94 points.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/kosta-browne-2017-one-sixteen-chardonnay-russian-river-valley/\">Kosta Browne 2017 One Sixteen Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)</a></strong>; $85, 94 points.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/ancien-2016-musque-chardonnay-coombsville/\">Ancien 2017 Musque Chardonnay (Coombsville)</a></strong>; $42, 93 points.</p></blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://253qv1sx4ey389p9wtpp9sj0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chardonnay_Everyday_California_Napa_Sonoma_Credit_Sam_Kaplan_1920x1280.jpg\"><img src=\"https://253qv1sx4ey389p9wtpp9sj0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chardonnay_Everyday_California_Napa_Sonoma_Credit_Sam_Kaplan_1920x1280.jpg\" alt=\"bottles of Chardonnay\"></a><figcaption>Photo by Sam Kaplan</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>California &#8211; Central Coast</strong></h2>\n<p>On one hand, as younger generations of winemakers look to Europe for inspiration, there&#8217;s an exciting explosion of wines that rely more on racy acidity and chalky tension to translate <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/2018/11/13/does-terroir-matter/\">terroir</a>. Many times, these are more concerned with texture than taste, yet the flavors can be stunning as well. They range from brisk stone fruit and Asian pear to citrus rind, sea salt and, yes, even savory hints of toasted almond and butter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m seeing the re-emergence of the fresh style,&#8221; says Eric Johnson, winemaker for Talley Vineyards. He&#8217;s made wine in San Luis Obispo County for 13 years. &#8220;The consumer is reacting favorably because there has been some consumer pushback on the big, oaky, viscous Chardonnays that, frankly, California is known for.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there remains plenty of area thirst for classic California Chardonnays, those rich, buttery, often nutty versions usually framed by ample oak and, when done well, still lively in citrus. The comforting opulence that made Chardonnay the most popular wine in America shows no sign of disappearing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I see a return of a riper, more plush style, but with balanced acidity,&#8221; says David Coventry, who&#8217;s made Chardonnay for around 22 years. He currently produces six different vintage bottlings for Talbott Vineyards in Monterey County. &#8220;Balance is the call of the day. I like to say, &#8216;Wines aren&#8217;t over-oaked. They are under-wined.&#8217;&#8221;</p>\n<p>As in much of life, the best wines fall somewhere in between the two extremes. They marry the zesty qualities that form within the region&#8217;s cooler winegrowing areas to the grape&#8217;s natural viscosity. These harness more lush fruit, spice and wood elements.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara County does this particularly well. &#8220;Even in the oak-driven styles, the acidity we see out here is rarely lost,&#8221; says Wynne Solomon, winemaker at Peake Ranch Winery. <em>&#8212;Matt Kettmann</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Recommended Wines from California-Central Coast</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/sandhi-2017-chardonnay-sta-rita-hills/\"><strong>Sandhi 2017 Bentrock Chardonnay (Sta.

But in some respects, the state is still looking to establish its identity with the grape.</p>\n<p>Washington seeks to get out from underneath California&#8217;s giant shadow. Its undulations in style have undue influence, and an ocean of Chardonnay crowds Washington shelves.</p>\n<p>Chardonnay is the state&#8217;s most produced white variety, and trails only <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/varietals/cabernet-sauvignon/\">Cabernet Sauvignon</a> overall. Styles can vary from racy, stainless-steel wines to 100% new-oak fermented and aged offerings, and everything in between. There is, however, a consistent thread.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we are much more elegant than California, just across the board, with a higher level of acidity,&#8221; says David Rosenthal, white winemaker for Chateau Ste. Michelle.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of reasons why the grape succeeds here. The ever-warm Columbia Valley, where the vast majority of the state&#8217;s wine grapes are grown, provides lush, ripe fruit flavors, while cool nights preserve natural acidity. This yields wines often fuller in style than their peers from Burgundy, but lighter and graced with more acidity than many offerings from California. As always with Washington, the wines can also provide superb value.</p>\n<p>While the state is awash in good Chardonnay, there are fewer great bottlings than one might expect. Many producers instead focus on red wines that command more money.<br>\nIn 2012, Rick Small of Woodward Canyon Winery said ruefully that &#8220;there may be 10 Washington producers that are working seriously with Chardonnay.&#8221; Things seem to be changing, though.</p>\n<p>Several Chardonnay-dedicated projects have launched, new producers have been trying their hands and growers explore novel terrain.</p>\n<p>The bottom line: Washington&#8217;s Chardonnay story is not yet fully written, but its compelling plot keeps you turning the page and looking forward to each forthcoming chapter. <em>&#8212;Sean P.

Yet, as a much-lauded producer of world-class Pinot Noir, why can&#8217;t Burgundy&#8217;s iconic white wine grape also thrive in Oregon? In fact, it does.</p>\n<p>The state&#8217;s Chardonnay renaissance began quietly with the introduction of Dijon clones to the Willamette Valley almost 30 years ago. Decades later, with experimentation in clonal selection, site development and improved winery practices accomplished, the subtlety and intensity of Oregon&#8217;s best versions differentiate them from the crowded West Coast competition.</p>\n<p>In ripe, balanced vintages such as 2016 and 2018, they retain vivid <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/2019/06/19/what-is-acidity-in-wine/\">acidity</a>, which brightens rich stone-fruit and tropical-fruit flavors. It also allows winemakers to cut back significantly on the percentage of new French oak used.</p>\n<p>In cooler vintages like 2017, the grape&#8217;s inherent transparency and elegance punches up the aromatics, bringing nuances of soil and site, herb and earth, along with crisp citrus fruit. Some winemakers try to enhance these qualities with all-stainless, concrete egg and clay amphorae-fermented wines, which prove that barrel aging is only an option, not a requirement, for complexity.</p>\n<p>The warmer, drier climate in Southern Oregon&#8217;s Rogue Valley amplifies tropical fruit flavors and yields round, forward wines that still retain moderate acidity. On the cool northern border demarcated by the Columbia River, the wines are leaner, with high-acid fruit flavors of citrus and green melon.</p>\n<p>Chardonnay&#8217;s epicenter, however, is the northern Willamette Valley, where producers have found success with native yeasts, mix-and-match fermentation vessels and non-intervention winemaking. Here, clonal and block selections abound, along with vineyard and appellation-specific bottlings.</p>\n<p>Excellent wines can be found at all price points. The 2016 and 2018 vintages are superb, but fine examples from 2017, which are generally more lightly ripened, are not hard to find. <em>&#8212;Paul Gregutt</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Recommended Wines from Oregon</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/domaine-serene-2016-cote-sud-vineyard-chardonnay-dundee-hills/\"><strong>Domaine Serene 2016 C&#244;te Sud Vineyard Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)</strong></a>; $80, 95 points. <i>Editors&#8217; Choice</i>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/walter-scott-2017-x-novo-chardonnay-eola-amity-hills/\"><strong>Walter Scott 2017 X-Novo Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)</strong></a>; $65, 94 points. <i>Cellar Selection</i>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/bethel-heights-2016-estate-chardonnay-eola-amity-hills/\"><strong>Bethel Heights 2016 Estate Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)</strong></a>; $32, 93 points. <i>Editors&#8217; Choice</i>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/lemelson-2016-reserve-chardonnay-willamette-valley/\"><strong>Lemelson 2016 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)</strong></a>; $30, 93 points.<i> Editors&#8217; Choice</i>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pike-road-2018-chardonnay-willamette-valley/\"><strong>Pike Road 2018 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)</strong></a>; $18, 91 points. <i>Editors&#8217; Choice</i>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/eola-hills-2016-chardonnay-oregon/\"><strong>Eola Hills 2016 Chardonnay (Oregon)</strong></a>; $15, 90 points. <i>Best Buy</i>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure><a href=\"https://253qv1sx4ey389p9wtpp9sj0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chardonnay_Everyday_Australia_Credit_Sam_Kaplan_1920x1280.jpg\"><img src=\"https://253qv1sx4ey389p9wtpp9sj0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chardonnay_Everyday_Australia_Credit_Sam_Kaplan_1920x1280.jpg\" alt=\"Bottles of Chardonnay\"></a><figcaption>Photo by Sam Kaplan</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Australia</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite some lingering stereotypes, the days of ripe, heavily oaked Chardonnay are long gone in Australia. While the style pendulum swung briefly to the opposite side in the early 2000s, which spawned a slew of ultralean Chablis imitations, modern Aussie &#8220;Chardy&#8221; has found a beautiful and delicious middle ground. Quality has never been higher.</p>\n<p>Chardonnay is grown across Australia, but those who fly the flag highest come from moderate-to-cool regions. These areas either scrape the edge of the ocean, like Tasmania, Margaret River in Western Australia, and Victoria&#8217;s Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley, or are perched high in hills and mountains, like Adelaide Hills in South Australia and the Canberra District.</p>\n<p>Selections from these key regions tend to be elegant and linear, with delicate citrus fruit. In warm, inland regions like Barossa in South Australia and Hunter Valley in New South Wales, fruitier, rounder expressions often prevail. Across the board, though, the wines express less oak and more acidity, texture and complexity.</p>\n<p>Regional expressions are evident, but the wines generally reflect a helping hand in the winery. Where later harvests, full malolactic fermentation and new American oak barrels were once popular choices here, modern versions are now handled more gently. Techniques employed include earlier picking, use of native yeasts and little or no malolactic fermentation.</p>\n<p>Instead, texture may be enhanced through aging on gross lees and/or a combination of new and old French oak barrels. Within a frame of freshness and texture lie other style choices, like the Aussie penchant for reductive Chards that yield struck match and seashell aromas. This polarizing style is becoming better managed to create a subtler expression. <em>&#8212;Christina Pickard</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Recommended Wines from Australia</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cullen-2017-kevin-john-wilyabrup-chardonnay-margaret-river/\"><strong>Cullen 2017 Kevin John Willyabrup Chardonnay (Margaret River)</strong></a>; $109, 95 points. <i>Cellar Selection</i>.

But much of that is made with a pronounced focus on quality rather than quantity.</p>\n<p>The skinny shape of the country&#8217;s two islands means that no vineyard is farther than 80 miles from the ocean. Cool temperatures and long hours of sunshine allow Chardonnay to grow practically everywhere, which yields elegant and fruity expressions etched in salty minerals with or without oak influence. The best can age for decades.</p>\n<p>In the warmer regions of the North Island, like Hawke&#8217;s Bay and Gisborne, Chardonnay is generally fragrant, fruity and lusciously textured, with premium bottlings destined for the cellar.</p>\n<p>In the far north, just outside Auckland, Kumeu River Wines has carved its reputation for Chardonnay. Its premium bottlings can be tightly wound and austere when young, but morph into multifaceted beauties over many years.</p>\n<p>Moving south, as temperatures drop, the style tends toward lighter-bodied, higher-acid selections with more citrus and mineral characters. Wairarapa, Marlborough, Nelson and Central Otago all grow it, with producers like Otago&#8217;s Felton Road renowned for the variety.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most exciting potential for Chardonnay in the South Island is the limestone-strewn Pyramid Valley area of North Canterbury. There, boutique producers like Pyramid Valley Vineyards and Bell Hill have worked magic with the grape. <em>&#8212;C.P.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Recommended Wines from New Zealand</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/pyramid-valley-2016-field-of-fire-chardonnay-north-canterbury/\"><strong>Pyramid Valley 2016 Field of Fire (North Canterbury)</strong></a>; $90, 96 points. <i>Editors&#8217; Choice</i>.

Such varied growing conditions welcome a range of wine styles and expressions affected not just by different soils and climates, but also winemaker preference and influence.</p>\n<p>Robertson is one of the top Wine of Origin (WO) appellations for Chardonnay. Conditions in the region are characterized by cold winters and dry, sunny summers, while cool afternoon breezes from the Agulhas coast deliver significant day-night temperature shifts. Soils high in limestone and clay assist in water retention. Together, these factors result in slow, steady ripening and high natural acidity.</p>\n<p>Hemel-en-Aarde is another prominent region that produces high-quality selections. Situated within Walker Bay, one of the <a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/2018/05/01/cool-vs-warm-climate-wine/\">coolest winegrowing areas</a> in the country, it boasts a maritime climate ideal for the production of fresh, elegant and well-balanced wines.</p>\n<p>Planted between 650&#8211;1,300 feet above sea level on diverse soil types largely composed of varying sedimentary rocks, Chardonnay here benefits from oceanic influence and cooling breezes. These factors allow it to retain vibrant natural acidity throughout ripening. That freshness is partnered with just-ripe fruit tones and varying site expressions that result in layered wines of great finesse and complexity.</p>\n<p>Elgin, another cool-climate WO, boasts vineyards between 820&#8211;1,300 feet above sea level. It&#8217;s home to benchmark Chardonnay producers Iona, Lothian Vineyards, Paul Cluver Wines and Richard Kershaw Wines, all of which produce fresh, balanced expressions marked by white-fruit flavors.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s in the riper, yellow-fruited Chardonnay camp that you&#8217;ll find the wines of Stellenbosch. With nearly 31,000 acres of vines, the climate here is generally warm and dry, which yields ripe fruit aromas and concentrated flavors. Breezes from False Bay cool vines from late afternoon until morning to help preserve the grape&#8217;s natural acidity and balance the abundant fruit tones. <em>&#8212;Lauren Buzzeo</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Recommended Wines from South Africa</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/cap-maritime-2017-chardonnay-upper-hemel-en-aarde-valley/\"><strong>Cap Maritime 2017 Chardonnay (Upper Hemel-en-Aarde Valley)</strong></a>; $54, 92 points.

This is not something that people drink any more. It's a&#160;historic drink and it was drunk in order to cure bone breakage and bruises,\" the museum's director, Mr Andreas Ahrens, who prepared the concoction himself, explains to AFP.</p>\n\n<p>He is adamant that \"now it smells more like alcohol than faeces\", as he removes the cap for a whiff. \"But when you're making it, the smell is quite horrendous,\" he admits.</p>\n<p>Visitors' reactions range from gag reflexes to smiles of amusement as they take in the different beverages on display. Among the pieces on show are both experimental items, like a Scottish beer with a 55 per cent alcohol level sold in a stuffed squirrel, and more widely produced drinks, like Fernet Branca, a bitter, herbal Italian liqueur.</p>\n<p>You will also find beer made with Icelandic whale testicles, Ugandan Waragi, a strong gin-like beverage, as well as \"pruno\", a wine made by American prisoners who famously let it ferment in toilets.</p>\n<p id=\"innity-in-post\"></p>\n\n<p>Visitors also get a glimpse into cultural differences when it comes to alcohol consumption. For instance Gammeldansk, a Danish bitter hard alcohol, is considered normal around Scandinavia, \"but in the rest of the world is considered quite disgusting,\" Mr Ahrens explains.</p>\n<p>\"It's the same with all the other items in the main exhibit. It's things that people like where it comes from, and might appear disgusting if you're not from there,\" he says.</p>\n<p>Ms Marie-Louise Syrjalainen described her visit as \"very exciting\", but stressed it was also \"very, very, very disgusting.\" \"It shows very unexpected things,\" she told AFP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its focus on repulsion, the Disgusting Food Museum has seen a growing number of visitors since opening its doors two years ago.</p>\n<p>In addition to Malmo, it has staged exhibitions in Nantes, Berlin and Los Angeles, but the Covid-19 pandemic health crisis forced it to close for a few weeks due to a lack of visitors.</p>\n<p>With the new alcohol exhibition, which will be on display for three months, Mr Ahrens hopes to entice visitors after months of scarcity.</p>\n\n</div></div></div></body></html>"
